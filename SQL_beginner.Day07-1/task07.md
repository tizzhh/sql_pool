1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please write a SQL statement to see 3 favorite restaurants by visits and by orders in one list (please add an action_type column with values ‘order’ or ‘visit’, it depends on data from the corresponding table). Please take a look at the sample of data below. The result should be sorted by action_type column in ascending mode and by count column in descending mode.

Please write a SQL statement to see restaurants are grouping by visits and by orders and joined with each other by using restaurant name.  
You can use internal SQLs from Exercise 02 (restaurants by visits and by orders) without limitations of amount of rows.

Additionally, please add the next rules.
- calculate a sum of orders and visits for corresponding pizzeria (be aware, not all pizzeria keys are presented in both tables).
- sort results by `total_count` column in descending mode and by `name` in ascending mode.
Take a look at the data sample below.

| name | total_count |

| Dominos | 13 |

We know about personal addresses from our data. Let’s imagine, that particular person visits pizzerias in his/her city only. Please write a SQL statement that returns address, pizzeria name and amount of persons’ orders. The result should be sorted by address and then by restaurant name. Please take a look at the sample of output data below.

| address | name |count_of_orders |
| ------ | ------ |------ |
| Kazan | Best Pizza |4 |
| Kazan | DinoPizza |4 |

Please write a SQL statement that returns aggregated information by person’s address , the result of “Maximal Age - (Minimal Age  / Maximal Age)” that is presented as a formula column, next one is average age per address and the result of comparison between formula and average columns (other words, if formula is greater than  average then True, otherwise False value).

The result should be sorted by address column. Please take a look at the sample of output data below.

| address | formula |average | comparison |
| ------ | ------ |------ |------ |
| Kazan | 44.71 |30.33 | true |
| Moscow | 20.24 | 18.5 | true |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
