1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Let’s expand our data model to involve a new business feature.
Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients.

Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other. Need to create a new relational table (please set a name `person_discounts`) with the next rules.
- set id attribute like a Primary Key (please take a look on id column in existing tables and choose the same data type)
- set for attributes person_id and pizzeria_id foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same like for id columns in corresponding parent tables)
- please set explicit names for foreign keys constraints by pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name},  for example `fk_person_discounts_person_id`
- add a discount attribute to store a value of discount in percent. Remember, discount value can be a number with floats (please just use `numeric` data type). So, please choose the corresponding data type to cover this possibility.

Actually, we created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our `person_discounts` table with new records.

So, there is a table `person_order` that stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (`INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`) that makes  inserts new records into `person_discounts` table based on the next rules.
- take aggregated state by person_id and pizzeria_id columns 
- calculate personal discount value by the next pseudo code:

    `if “amount of orders” = 1 then
        “discount” = 10.5 
    else if “amount of orders” = 2 then 
        “discount” = 22
    else 
        “discount” = 30`

- to generate a primary key for the person_discounts table please use  SQL construction below (this construction is from the WINDOW FUNCTION  SQL area).
    
    `... ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER ( ) AS id ...`

Please write a SQL statement that returns orders with actual price and price with applied discount for each person in the corresponding pizzeria restaurant and sort by person name, and pizza name. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

| name | pizza_name | price | discount_price | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |

Actually, we have to make improvements to data consistency from one side and performance tuning from the other side. Please create a multicolumn unique index (with name `idx_person_discounts_unique`) that prevents duplicates of pair values person and pizzeria identifiers.

After creation of a new index, please provide any simple SQL statement that shows proof of index usage (by using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).
The example of “proof” is below
    
    ...
    Index Scan using idx_person_discounts_unique on person_discounts
    ...

Please add the following constraint rules for existing columns of the `person_discounts` table.
- person_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_person_id`)
- pizzeria_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_pizzeria_id`)
- discount column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_discount`)
- discount column should be 0 percent by default
- discount column should be in a range values from 0 to 100 (use constraint name `ch_range_discount`)

To satisfy Data Governance Policies need to add comments for the table and table's columns. Let’s apply this policy for the `person_discounts` table. Please add English or Russian comments (it's up to you) that explain what is a business goal of a table and all included attributes.

Please be aware that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on formula “amount of rows in person_discounts table” + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.
