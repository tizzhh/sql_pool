1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also `person_visits` table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by `person_id` column and your final SQL please present in `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) to be honest, the definition “symmetric union” doesn’t exist in Set Theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.

Please create a Database View `v_price_with_discount` that returns a person's orders with person names, pizza names, real price and calculated column `discount_price` (with applied 10% discount and satisfies formula `price - price*0.1`). The result please sort by person name and pizza name and make a round for `discount_price` column to integer type. Please take a look at a sample result below.
